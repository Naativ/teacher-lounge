            <br>
          <p style="font-size: 20px;">We're excited to see a small increase in teacher bookings over the past few weeks! While we expect to see gradual growth, we still advise teachers to be judicious in the availability they open in Naativ. Thank you for your patience!</p>
          <br>
          <h2>Platform Updates</h2>
          <br>
          <p>We are excited to announce that we are adding two new features: (1) Adult curriculum (geared towards adults, professionals, and students at least 15 years old) and (2) conversation sessions! Adult lessons are now live and conversations with be released soon.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Within the next two weeks, we will introduce two new assessments: one for younger students and a seperate assessment for adults/older students. We will post these assessments and provide a training prior to them going live. More information coming soon.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Conversation sessions will be 12 minute open-talk sessions that will allow students the opportunity to practice speaking and asking questions. Teachers will be paid for these at their same hourly rate (half the rate paid for a lesson, as they are half the time). Although we expect that most conversation sessions will be booked by older students and adults, younger
            students will also have the opportunity to book them.</p>
          <p>You can decide what part of the student population you teach. Within the Teacher's Lounge, under Profile, there is a new section for Preferences. Here you can choose to appear in Youth or Adult Availability searches, or both. By default, you are selected to teach both. So, if you are interested in only teaching one type of student, please make sure to update your
            profile accordingly. At the release of conversation sessions, you will also be able to choose if you would like to participate in those or not.</p>
          <p>If you have any questions, please email <a href="mailto:support@naativ.com">support@naativ.com.</a> We hope that these new services will not only attract more students but provide a broader and more enjoyable experience for you as teachers.</p>

          <h3>Common Questions from Support Channels</h3>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>Q. How do I know if I'm appearing in Teacher Availability searches?</li>
            <li>A. In your Teacher's Lounge, there is an info panel on the right side of the page with your Profile Pic at the top (or a grey bubble with initials, if you haven't set a Profile Pic). Toward the bottom of this panel, there is a section for your Profile Status. If it is listed as Complete, you will appear for any Availability you set. If it says Incomplete, you
              most likely still need to set a Profile Pic.</li>
            <li>Q. How do I set a Profile Pic?</li>
            <li>A. You can upload photos to your Profile through the Library, by selecting "Profile Only" while uploading. Once uploaded, go to your Profile and click on the three dots in the lower right corner of the photo. You can have several photos show in your Profile (selected here), but only one can be set to "Profile Pic," and one is required to complete the Profile.
            </li>
            <li>Q. How do I select a Profile Link?</li>
            <li>A. Go to Profile->Account and enter the link name you'd like under "Your Shareable Profile Link." These links are available on a first come, first served basis. If your name is no longer available you can try adding a last initial to it, or anything else you'd like. The link is permanent and cannot be changed once set.</li>
            <li>Q. What do I do with a Profile Link?</li>
            <li>A. You can share it with those in your network whom you might want to invite to your profile, just as you would your LinkedIn or other social media link.</li>

            <br>
              <p style="font-size: 20px;">The time has come to start to verify all teachers’ education and certification credentials. This will happen through the Naativ Portal and, at some point in the near future, will be a requirement in order for Naativ teachers to open their availability.</p>
            <br>
          <h3>How to Submit Your Documents for Verification</h3>
          <br>
          <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
            <li> - In your Naativ Portal, go to <strong>Profile</strong>, then select the <strong>Verification</strong> tab at thetop of the page.</li>
            <br>
            <li> - <strong>Click on the plus sign icon</strong> in the top right corner to upload your documents. You will need to provide a document for each credential you claim. If you do not have any certifications outside of your degree, you will only need to upload a copy of your diploma/transcript. If you claim a state teaching certificate, TESOL, or TEFL certification, you will need to provide evidence for each claim.</li>
            <br>
            <li> - Naativ will review and confirm all submitted documentation. If there is a question or concern about any submitted documentation, you will be contacted.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <h3>Accepted Documents: </h3>
          <br>
          <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
            <li> - Proof of Degree (at a minimum, Bachelor’s Degree, but any other degrees claimed must be verified as well). We will accept a copy of a diploma or transcript.</li>
            <br>
            <li> - State-Issued Teaching Certificate</li>
            <br>
            <li> - TESOL certificate</li>
            <br>
            <li> - TEFL certificate</li>
          </ul>
          <br>

              We will be holding a Corporate Update webinar on Wednesday, April
              10th at 2 pm MDT (4 pm EDT/I pm PDT). We know things have been a
              bit quiet lately and we're eager to share what we've been working on.

The teacher site has changed to <a href="https://teach.naativ.com" target="_blank">https://teach.naativ.com</a>. In the future, we will do our best to reroute you to the teacher site through www.naativ.com if you are accessing from the US or Canada, but we recommend that everyone change their bookmarks to the new URL.</li>

            <li>We continue to make progress with our learning partners and the other marketing methods we have discussed in previous weeks. We are shifting focus from smaller institutions to larger institutions in S. Korea.</li>
            <li>While we are thrilled to see some traction in Brazil (which slowed this week, due to Carnival), Asia is still our main focus at this time.</li>
            <li>We expect assessments and classes to continue to grow throughout this month.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: 500;">We will share when we believe large numbers of students are coming in, so you can set your availability.</span> We’re grateful for the teachers that have set availability so far, but, as we have stated many times before, we still encourage teachers to take guaranteed income opportunities, if needed.</li>

            <li>Q.&ensp; When will the year begin for the $25/hr bonus?</li>
            <li>A.&ensp;The date for the $25/hr bonus for teachers with numbers 1299 and below will be extended, to begin when teachers are teaching regularly. This date is TBD. (The previous date for this bonus to run through was 2/29/2020.)</li>
            <br>
            <li>Q.&ensp;Are we still interviewing new teachers?</li>

            <li>Q.&ensp;I heard that Naativ hired a teacher with a teacher number above 5,000?</li>
            <li>A.&ensp;Last week we interviewed someone that registered with Naativ on November 13th and had an original Teacher # in the 1000s. Her original profile was corrupted. After discovering this issue, we honored her chance to interview as part of the first round even though she was allocated a new number in the 5,000s.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Q.&ensp;How many teachers do we have? 1400 or 5000+?</li>
            <li>A.&ensp;5,000+, although only 1,400 are currently allowed to teach. Teachers agree to their Independent Contractor Agreement when they apply with Naativ. We treat any teacher that applied as one of our teachers, even though they may need to do some things in order to teach, including complete an interview, verify degrees or certificates, or submit to a background check (which is coming for all teachers soon).</li>

          <p><span style="font-weight: 500;">From Mikelle, on The Effects of Rudeness:&ensp;</span>The Teacher Experience at Naativ is limited to the Facebook group (official and unofficial groups) right now, and eclipsed by incivility at times. We have a lot of cool things we want to offer our teachers, once we are teaching students on a regular basis. Kindness is important and matters because rudeness matters. Rudeness produces neurotoxins. Rudeness creates workplace dissatisfaction. Some people feel they need to be rude to be heard. Teachers will be heard much better through emails and direct messages. Rudeness is creating a bad experience for everyone witnessing it and going against the culture we are trying to create at Naativ. Debate does not need to be rude. Debate is constructive. Rudeness is destructive. We want happy, healthy teachers, and rudeness won’t allow for that.</p>
          <br>
          <p><span style="font-weight: 500;">From Katie, on Embracing Your Own Teaching Style:&ensp;</span>Katie had her first child in 1996 and her main resource for parenting was “What to Expect” books. She had her last child 19 years later and discovered “Mom Bloggers” and began feeling like she was failing. “You cannot compare your everyday parenting to someone else’s highlights.” Likewise, there are a lot of ways to compare yourselves to other online teachers. Use those methods to learn from other teachers, but not to compare yourselves to them. You are the perfect teacher for your students. Katie suggested a number of questions you can ask yourself to gauge how you are doing as a teacher. If you are getting rebooked by the same student and receiving feedback from the parent, that’s a great sign.  “Owning our story and loving ourselves through that process is the bravest thing that we’ll ever do.” – Brené Brown</p>

          <h5>Naativ Teacher Weekly</h5>
          <br>
          <p style="text-decoration: underline">Student Market Update:</p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
            <li>We’re excited to hear from some of our in-market learning partners and social media influencers during next week’s webinar. Please remember that we will post a recording and a summary of the webinar afterward. We hope you’ll be able to join in some capacity. Registration link to follow.</li>
            <li>S. Korea and Japan: We continued to make good progress over this past week. It takes time to integrate with large institutions, but we are getting there. We expect to see a larger number of students (Korean students in particular) register and take assessments, starting this next week. We entered into agreements over the past week with a couple of new learning partners in S. Korea. We also have partnered with a worldwide Korean media company that will be marketing Naativ around the globe.</li>
            <li>Brazil: We had more Brazilian lessons over this past week than other markets, which was a nice surprise. As we previously shared, we are currently running a social media influencer campaign with some wonderful Brazilian mothers that have Brazilian social media followings! A few of these influencers have already enrolled their children in assessments and shared their experiences across their social channels. We expect to continue to see Brazilian students register as we move forward. However, please note, S. Korea and Japan are still our primary markets. Although some teachers may start to see students schedule with them from Brazil, we expect that most students will come from S. Korea and Japan.</li>
            <li>We want to especially thank those teachers that have already taught, for the wonderful work they have done. Almost every lesson taught has been a success. These early lessons are extremely important, especially because many of these lessons are with students or children of individuals that are trying Naativ out on behalf of much larger organizations or followings. As these initial assessments go well, not only will the students in these lessons register, but they will open the door for us to be able to teach many other students. So, again, thank you for providing such a wonderful experience!</li>

          <p style="text-decoration: underline">Common Questions from Support Channels:</p>

            <li><a href="mailto:support@naativ.com">support@naativ.com</a>:
            <ul style="text-decoration: circle">
              <li>Q. When will teachers start seeing bookings?</li>
              <li>A. A handful of assessments were booked and taught over the past two weeks, but the number of assessments has been few up to this point. Based on the progress we have made in February, we expect bookings to increase throughout the month of March.</li>
              <li>Q. When will we start interviewing/hiring again? (And how many teachers have been hired?)</li>
              <li>A. From a Facebook Announcement: “We've heard there are some concerns over the number of teachers that Naativ has hired to date. We are still just over 1400 hired teachers. Our marketing material addresses the number of certified teachers that have registered to teach with Naativ, just over 5400 currently. This is not a fabrication, it's a marketing appeal to build our student base. College degrees are certificates. We will be requesting these in the near future, as well as conducting background checks. We have not begun another round of interviewing and will not do so until our student base can support it.”</li>
              <li>Q. What are peak teaching hours?</li>
              <li>A. See below for projected time, soon to change with DST.

          <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
            <li>Profiles now provide a confirmation when they are complete. We hope that this helps remove some confusion, especially in regard to whether a photo is set as a Profile Pic. You must have a photo set as your Profile Pic to appear for bookings.</li>

          <br>
          <p>“People often silence themselves, or "agree to disagree" without fully exploring the actual nature of the disagreement, for the sake of protecting a relationship and maintaining connection. But when we avoid certain conversations, and never fully learn how the other person feels about all of the issues, we sometimes end up making assumptions that not only perpetuate but deepen misunderstandings, and that can generate resentment.” -Brené Brown, Braving the Wilderness: The Quest for True Belonging and the Courage to Stand Alone. We’re grateful to have a community of teachers who continue to treat each other with civility and respect, even when difficult conversations arise. We’ll continue to try to lean in during these conversations. We hope you’ll do the same.</p>

          <p style="text-decoration: underline">Student Market Update:</p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
            <li>Our marketing team continues to work with our various Education Partners across all markets. Caroline spent this past week in Japan and had several great meetings.</li>

            <li>Influencer and other marketing campaigns are beginning to run across all markets, although we still expect our Education Partners will be the quickest route path to access to large student communities and networks.</li>
            <li>Although still slow, some of our teachers have started to hold their first lessons. We want to thank Amanda P. for sharing her first lesson experience! (see below)</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p style="text-decoration: underline">Common Questions from Support Channels:</p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
            <li><a href="mailto:techsupport@naativ.com">techsupport@naativ.com</a>: The most common questions here over the last week were about teachers not showing up in the rotation of 12 when viewing an availability slot. This was due to availability being opened in half hour blocks, rather than a larger block and a fix has been pushed. All teachers with a complete profile (profile pic) and availability are now showing in the rotation.</li>

            <li>Classrooms can now be entered 24 hours in advance of any booking. Teachers will still need to connect to the class within 5 minutes of the start time.</li>
            <li>Coming soon: email notifications for bookings</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p style="text-decoration: underline">Thanks to Amanda for sharing her experience with her first assessment!</p>
          <p>“I taught my first class this morning at 8am CST. It was a precious little girl (assuming from South America). I'm completely in love with her already. She was a beginner with some basic knowledge of colors. Mom was there to help and she was fantastic.</p>
          <p>The class platform was perfect, not at all buggy. Tips were available but I based the assessment off of her abilities and attention span. I improvised with songs and other fun activities. I had no problem reaching the 25-minute mark with the Colors Assessment for this beginner. The extension tips would have been perfectly sufficient if I was teaching an intermediate or advanced student in this assessment.</p>
          <p>Feedback is the easiest in the industry based on my experience. You "place" the student by clicking a button and tick off prefilled sentences based on how the student did. So, I think if you finish at 25 min, you will have no problem leaving feedback and being ready for B2B classes.</p>
          <p>Getting up for an 8 am class in CST for a lovely little girl in South America is a dream come true for me. I loved hearing the language that I studied throughout college as she worked so incredibly hard to speak English. This was a very special moment for me.</p>
          <p>For everyone who has been frustrated (and I will admit I was too at times) the wait will be worth it. I believe that if Naativ keeps moving forward as they've said they would, this absolutely will be a blessing for all of the passionate teachers out there like me.</p>
          <p>I will be walking around with a huge smile on my face for the rest of the day! Thank you Naativ!”</p>

          <p>We appreciate the feedback we’ve received lately, especially regarding the Facebook group. We assure you that we will continue to provide visibility into Naativ as much as possible. A strengthened focus on our student markets has increased the need for our team to stay concentrated and organized; the main reason for increased moderation in our Facebook group.  We still welcome all feedback and criticism in our support email channels (<a href="mailto:support@naativ.com">support@naativ.com</a> and <a href="mailto:techsupport@naativ.com">techsupport@naativ.com</a>), where we can address it in an organized manner and work with you in a personal way. From our beloved Brené Brown: “Social Media are helpful in cultivating connection only to the extent that they’re used to create real community where there is structure, purpose and meaning, and some face-to-face content.” We hope to cultivate relationships with our teachers moving forward and we will strengthen those bonds as our student base grows. What we really look forward to, as stated in the past, is meeting with as many of you as possible in person. We appreciate your patience and civility as we work hard to reach that objective. Many teachers have shared feedback and even criticism of Naativ in a respectful and constructive manner. This is the gold standard that we hope all will strive to reach.</p>

          <h3>2 January 2019</h3>
          <p>Hey Naativ Family, our students are excited to meet you!</p>
          <p>It’s hard to believe that our students are probably even more excited for the end of January than we are! Well, let’s give those cute kiddos what they want! With the Naativ Library, we can get a head-start on making those special connections with future students!</p>
          <p>The Naativ Library has two sections: one will be a resource for our students, while the other will serve as a resource for Naativ teachers. The student section of the library contains teacher-generated content about topics ranging from phonics and parts of speech, all the way to culture and daily activities. Feel free to create content videos based off of any and/or all of the learning topics that you especially love teaching! The possibilities are almost endless, but remember to stick to a few guidelines:</p>

          <p>-Videos can be a maximum 3 minutes in length</p>
          <p>-High quality sound, lighting, classroom environment</p>
          <p>-Use appropriate speaking speed and language for level of student audience</p>
          <p>-Naativ student safety is a top priority, therefore all videos must be approved before they are added to the Naativ Library</p>

          <p>The teacher section of the library will undoubtedly become a favorite hangout spot for new and veteran teachers alike! Here you can upload content such as teaching grammar tips, prop ideas, funny teaching moments, or even lighting expertise. Together, we can change the world, so let’s help each other along the way!</p>
          <p>All-in-all, the Naativ Library can open up exciting new opportunities for students and teachers! But what could make this sweeter? Prizes! There are three prize-winning categories. Each winner (4 total) in the three categories below receive a $50 Amazon gift card, and their videos will be featured in the upcoming Naativ webinar!</p>

          <p>-Most Videos (student section)</p>
          <p>-Most Videos (both teacher and student sections combined)</p>
          <p>-Most Creative Video (1 winner in teacher section, 1 winner in student section)</p>
          <p>**Video content submitted and approved by JANUARY 15th, 5PM MST will be eligible for incentive.**</p>

          <p>The Naativ Library is live now and waiting for you in your teacher portal! Check it out, get those cameras rolling, and let your creativity run wild! Please ask Danica or Sarah any questions you may have!</p>
          <p>Sincerely,</p>

          <h3>27 December 2018</h3>
          <p>We are excited to start introducing new aspects of the Naativ teaching platform over the next few weeks as we approach our launch at the end of January.</p>
          <p>One of the first initiatives that we are excited to release very soon is the Naativ Resource Library. The Library will include content that is developed exclusively BY our Naativ community FOR our Naativ community. We will have content for both students and teachers. So, for those of you that are interested in sharing your knowledge and skills (and personality), we hope that you will contribute to the Library.</p>
          <p>We have asked a couple of amazing teachers within our community, Danica Gregory-Santana and Sarah Yeager, to help lead and manage the Library. Danica will lead content development efforts for our students and teachers. Sarah will lead content development associated with your profiles (and will be a liaison between you and our development team to make sure that profile content helps you book classes).</p>
          <p>One of the main reasons why we want to support the Library is that it will provide each of you the opportunity to not only contribute to the Naativ community, but may also be a way for students to meet you and, hopefully, book with you. All students will have access to the Library. If a student watches your video or downloads a PDF of something that you created and likes you, they will be able to connect to your profile and schedule a lesson with you.</p>
          <p>We hope that the Library becomes a great resource for you and this community! More details to come soon.</p>
          <p>Thank you again for joining Naativ during pre-launch! Lots of exciting announcements will be shared over the next few weeks! Go Naativ!</p>
